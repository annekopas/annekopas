	Experience
</h1>

<br>
<h2>Redleaf Press</h2>
	<p>
	I spent the summer of 2016 working as a Sales and Editorial Intern for <a href="http://www.redleafpress.org/" target="_blank">Redleaf Press</a>, a publishing company that produces materials for early childhood educators.  My work included proofreading, fact-checking, reading and reporting on manuscript submissions, preparing manuscripts for epub conversion, and general editorial tasks. I was responsible for an email campaign to solicit reviews for an upcoming children&#8217;s picture book, and I successfully gained multiple positive reviews from booksellers.
	</p>

<h2>TommieMedia</h2>
	<p>
	I am currently working as the Web Manager for <a href="http://tommiemedia.com/" target="_blank">TommieMedia</a>, St. Thomas&#8217;s student-run news and media organization.  I am responsible for general website upkeep and tech support. I have also redesigned several website elements using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I monitor the site&#8217;s email subscription database.
	</p>

<h2>St. Thomas Library Interlibrary Loan Department</h2>
	<p>
	During the summer of 2016, I worked part-time at the St. Thomas <a href="http://www.stthomas.edu/libraries/about/default.html#osf" target="_blank">O'Shaughnessy-Frey Library</a> as the InterLibrary Loan Student Assistant.  I worked to ensure library materials were sent to the right places, including tracking down requests, scanning chapters and articles to send to library users, and similar tasks.
	</p>

<h2>The Odyssey</h2>
<p>
	In February of 2016, I became a staff writer for 
	<a href="http://theoddysseyonline.com" target="_blank">The Odyssey</a>,
	a nationally-known online blog written for college students, by college students.  That month, the site had over 30 million unique visitors and is growing fast.  You can view 
	<a href="https://theodysseyonline.com/author/annekopas" target="_blank">all of my Odyssey articles</a> 
	here. 
</p>

<h2>Communications &amp; Journalism Writing Tutor</h2>
	<p>
	Since October of 2015, I have worked as UST&#8217;s only Communications &amp; Journalism <a href="http://www.stthomas.edu/cojo/cojomedialabandwritingtutor/" target="_blank">Writing Tutor</a>.  I have weekly office hours where I help students with all stages of the writing process, including organization and idea development, drafting, and revising.
	</p>

<h2>McCarthy Gym</h2>
	<p>
	Since February of 2015, I have worked as a front desk attendant at the St. Thomas <a href="https://www.stthomas.edu/mccarthygym/" target="_blank">McCarthy Gym</a>.  My duties include assisting gym visitors with check-in and equipment rental, as well as various customer service and data entry tasks.
	</p>


<h2>The Epic, the Awesome, and the Random</h2>
	<p>
	In January of 2011, I started a blog called
		<a href="http://anniesepicblog.blogspot.com" target="_blank">The Epic, the Awesome, and the Random</a>
	 to review books and talk about my passion for writing.  Since then, it has grown to include movie reviews and other assorted topics, though it still centers on books.  In its best month, it had almost 8,000 pageviews.  Over the years, I have had the opportunity to interact with many other readers and writers through the blog.  It gained attention from the blogging and writing community, earning a spot on author 
		<a href="http://blog.janicehardy.com/p/online-resources.html" target="_blank">Janice Hardy&#8217;s list of online resources</a>.
	I no longer post as frequently as I used to, but I still keep the blog updated as frequently as possible.
