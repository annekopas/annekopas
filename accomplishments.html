<h3>Summit Avenue Review</h3> <!-- hey, please remember to look for symbols that need codes -->
<p>
	My short fiction piece &#8220;Wax&#8221; was published in the 2015 issue of the 
	<a href="http://www.stthomas.edu/summitavenuereview/" target="_blank"><em>Summit Avenue Review</em></a>,
 	the University of St. Thomas literary magazine. The magazine is published annually by undergraduate English students and features work by undergraduates, graduate students, alumni, and other members of the St. Thomas community.  My poem "XX" and short story "Auburn" appeared in the 2016 issue.

<h3>The Epic, the Awesome, and the Random</h3>
<p>
	In January of 2011, I started a blog called
		<a href="http://anniesepicblog.blogspot.com" target="_blank">The Epic, the Awesome, and the Random</a>
	 to review books and talk about my passion for writing.  Since then, it has grown to include movie reviews and other assorted topics, though it still centers on books.  In its best month, it had almost 8,000 pageviews.  Over the years, I have had the opportunity to interact with many other readers and writers through the blog.  It gained attention from the blogging and writing community, earning a spot on author 
		<a href="http://blog.janicehardy.com/p/online-resources.html" target="_blank">Janice Hardy&#8217;s list of online resources</a>.
	I no longer post as frequently as I used to, but I still keep the blog updated as frequently as possible.
</p>

<h3>The Odyssey</h3>
<p>
	In February of 2016, I became a staff writer for 
	<a href="http://theoddysseyonline.com" target="_blank">The Odyssey</a>,
	a nationally-known online blog written for college students, by college students.  That month, the site had over 30 million unique visitors and is growing fast.  You can view 
	<a href="https://theodysseyonline.com/author/annekopas" target="_blank">all of my Odyssey articles</a> 
	here.

</div><!--imgright-->

<p>
	Each year since 2011, the city of Northfield, MN, has held a 
	<a href="http://www.ci.northfield.mn.us/DocumentCenter/View/3221" target="_blank">contest</a>
	 in which the winners get their poems installed in downtown sidewalks.  In 2015, two of my poems were winners, and are now embedded in the sidewalks.  The two poems are among nine total winners chosen from over one hundred entries.  You can read the 
	<a href="http://www.ci.northfield.mn.us/DocumentCenter/View/3221" target="_blank">full list of winning poems</a>
	 online.

<h3>Delta Epsilon Sigma National Writing Contest</h3>
<p>
	In the spring of 2016, I was chosen as a second-place winner of the 
	<a href="http://www.deltaepsilonsigma.org/en-us/competition/default.aspx?qs=1&view=pages&p=1" target="_blank">Delta Epsilon Sigma annual writing contest</a>.
	Delta Epsilon Sigma is a national scholastic honor society for students at Catholic universities.
</p>

<h3>Aquinas Scholars Honors Program</h3>
<p>
	I am a member of the 
	<a href="http://www.stthomas.edu/aquinasscholars/" target="_blank">Aquinas Scholars Honors Program</a>
	 at St. Thomas.  The program is for students with a GPA above 3.6 and consists of honors courses and team-taught experimental seminars, as well as social activities and service events.  
</p>

<h3>UW Madison Literati Conference</h3>
<p>
	In April 2016, I presented at the University of Wisconsin-Madison&#8217;s annual 
	<a href="http://www.museuw.com/mission.html" target="_blank">Literati conference</a>,  
	sponsored by the Madison Undergraduate Society for English.  The 2016 theme is &#8220;transitions,&#8221; and I presented my paper titled &#8220;Gender as Power: Beowulf and the Wife of Bath&#8217;s Hyper-Representation.&#8221;
</p>

<h3>Students for Justice &amp; Peace Homepage</h3>
<p>
	I worked with <a href="http://personal.stthomas.edu/kopa0002/sjp" target="_blank">Students for Justice &amp; Peace</a>, a student-led organization at UST, to design a web page for the group.  The page was designed from scratch, an includes an overview of the group&#8217;s mission, selected examples of their past work, and information about how to join.
